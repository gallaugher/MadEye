Above simply adds the .stl 3D printing files & changes to the config.h that I used in my build. All coolness credit goes to Phil!
Build a magical Mad Eye Wearable, Rechargeable, blinking, winky prop.
Learn to build a Magical Mad Eye that blinks, winks, and looks around. The product is portable, wearable, and rechargeable. This lesson will show you how to build both OLED and TFT versions using an Adafruit Feather M4 Express, which is a great board to use because it's small and supports pass-through lipo battery charging. Step by step instructions take you through installing and modifying code and assembly of the product.
