# MadEye
A customized veresion of the Uncanny Eyes project by Phil Burgess. See Phil's code for the Arduino files. Below are simply the 3D printing files & config.h that I used in my build.
Build a magical Mad Eye Wearable, Rechargeable, blinking, winky prop.
Learn to build a Magical Mad Eye that blinks, winks, and looks around. The product is portable, wearable, and rechargeable. This lesson will show you how to build both OLED and TFT versions using an Adafruit Feather M4 Express, which is a great board to use because it's small and supports pass-through lipo battery charging. Step by step instructions take you through installing and modifying code and assembly of the product.
